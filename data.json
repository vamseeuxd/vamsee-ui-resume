I am passionate about doing things right and doing them quickly. These are not antithetical; a proper knowledge of principles, action in the face of ambiguity, and diplomacy to coax the best from all can nurture a self-organized software team. Above all I want to invest in people I believe in and promote a company that I know represents my values.",
